## Raison d'Ãªtre

This part is heavily inspired from [pg-protocol](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/blob/master/packages/pg-protocol), of which it is the other side of the mirror (pg-protocol defines `how to send commands & receive data from a db` while here, we're defining `how to receive commands & send data`)
